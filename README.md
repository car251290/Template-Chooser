# Template-Chooser
Template that choose Word document.

#The second experience with Add-in

This Add-In and I made using Visual Studio and in the same language Javascript 
This case selected the document and display it in the Word document, To make a chooser it will be subtitle and they click the button and each of them will display templates and the user will select them, depends what type of document they are looking to display in Microsoft Word.

I code this function to display different subjects of templates in a list, also I code the view of the Add-in using the tools of CSS and HTML.
